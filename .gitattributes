# Force Git to store these PowerShell files with CRLF line endings and UTF-8 BOM exactly as-is.
# We use `-text` to disable Git's automatic line-ending normalization, because `text eol=crlf`
# still allowed Git to store files with LF-only endings during commits in CI environments (e.g., GitHub runners).
# WARNING: Using `-text` disables Git diffs for these files, but is necessary to preserve formatting.
